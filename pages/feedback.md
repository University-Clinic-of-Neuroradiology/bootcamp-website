We hope you're enjoying our Python Bootcamp. We're always looking to improve and would love to hear your feedback. It would be important for us to have a comparison of your knowledge/skills before and after the bootcamp. We would therefore ask you to complete both questionnaires.

**Please take a few minutes to fill out our questionnaire:**

- Pre-survey: Set the stage. What are your expectations? Lay it all out for us.
  - English: [![Feedback](https://img.shields.io/badge/Feedback-red.svg)](https://forms.gle/bjxgwEe3rPoj8g99A)
  - German: [![Feedback](https://img.shields.io/badge/Feedback-red.svg)](https://forms.gle/6WmDdUAmNXXUvnydA)

- Final survey: Reflect and rejoice. Did we hit the mark? What pearls of wisdom did you gather?
  - English: [![Feedback](https://img.shields.io/badge/Feedback-red.svg)](https://forms.gle/gU3XxRJpvWsQLYtQ6)
  - German: [![Feedback](https://img.shields.io/badge/Feedback-red.svg)](https://forms.gle/JX5fT5915w9SHU8HA)
