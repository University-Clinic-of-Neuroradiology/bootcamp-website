We hope you're enjoying our Python Bootcamp. We're always looking to improve and would love to hear your feedback. It would be important for us to have a comparison of your knowledge/skills before and after the bootcamp. We would therefore ask you to complete both questionnaires.

**Please take a few minutes to fill out our questionnaire:**

- Pre-survey: Set the stage. What are your expectations? Lay it all out for us.
  - English: [![Feedback](https://img.shields.io/badge/Feedback-red.svg)](https://forms.gle/yb4ALTYZNqP9iMYMA)
  - German: [![Feedback](https://img.shields.io/badge/Feedback-red.svg)](https://forms.gle/6BqMkjzTYnbCj2Jo6)

- Final survey: Reflect and rejoice. Did we hit the mark? What pearls of wisdom did you gather?
  - English: [![Feedback](https://img.shields.io/badge/Feedback-red.svg)](https://forms.gle/1CAPNZQUXqmMaQYr6)
  - German: [![Feedback](https://img.shields.io/badge/Feedback-red.svg)](https://forms.gle/JLGC237pbgSWyrv3A)

Your feedback is very important to us. Thank you for helping us improve our Python Bootcamp!
