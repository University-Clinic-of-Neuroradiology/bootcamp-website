## 📄 Description
This directory contains a few basic notebooks to learn more about the DICOM file format, the conversion to Nifti and other additional file formats.

By the end of these notebooks, you should feel more comfortable with:
- the basics of DICOM data
- to handle DICOM metadata and to modify these
- Nifti file format and how to convert different file formats


## 📣 Current announcements
The notebook "Basic concepts of DICOM" is particularly important for understanding the structure of medical image data. The other two notebooks show the conversion into other file formats that are important for post-processing.


## ❗ Course requirements
- you should have completed the [Introductory](./python_basics.md) notebooks
- have a look at the theoretical basics before you start with the notebooks
