## 📄 Description
This directory contains a few basic notebooks to learn more about time analysis, like EEG or EMG.

By the end of these notebooks, you should feel more comfortable with:

- load and analyze medical time series, such as EEG, ECG and EMG
- ...


## 📣 Current announcements
This skill track is optional for the time being and is not part of the bootcamp. We still need to make some changes. But if you want to try out the skill track, feel free to do so!


## ❗ Course requirements
- you should have completed all previous skill tracks
- in this notebook we use data from open-source databases (the references are at the bottom of the page); in Google Colab the data is loaded automatically at the beginning of the notebook
- have a look at the theoretical basics before you start with the notebooks
