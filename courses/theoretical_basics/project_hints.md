## Part I
Skill Tracks [Introductory](../python_basics.md) and [Data Management](./data_management.md) can be used to help with Part I.

### 1. Import Python Libraries
There are many ways to load the necessary functions. Think carefully about whether it is necessary to load the entire package or just individual functions. Synonyms/abbreviations are also useful to minimise the writing effort.

### 2. Import and read the dataset
`pandas` offers a direct function for importing csv files. In addition, you should set the 1st column as an index. This makes further work easier.

### 3. Check the dataset
Helpful functions here are `.value_counts()`, `.select_dtypes()` and `.corr()`.
