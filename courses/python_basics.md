## üìù Theoretical basics
For some information on the topic, take a look at the [slides](https://raw.githack.com/University-Clinic-of-Neuroradiology/python-bootcamp/main/notebooks/Introductory/slides/Introductory.slides.html#/).

Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the world. It is used for a wide variety of tasks, including data analysis. It has also become the language of choice for machine learning. 

### The print()-Function
One of the first things you will probably do is output (print). To write information, you can use the `print()` function and implement it as a core function. As it is a core function, you will automatically have access to it if Python is installed. To use `print()` in your program, use an argument:
```python
print('Hello World!')
```

### Variables
As one of the basics of programming, you need to know that you are processing data. Since your program works with data, you may need to remember a certain value while running the program. You use variables to do this.

In the following example, a variable is declared (saved) and then output:
```python
x = 5

print(x)
```

### Data types
A variable requires a data type. In the previous program, `x` assumes the type `int`. However, there are many other data types. Here are some basic examples that you are likely to come across:

| data type | descrition | example                                        |
|-------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Numerical type      | Number, with or without decimals           | `int, float, complex, no = 3`                            |
| Text type     | String     | `str = "a literal string"`                  |
| Boolean type       | Boolean          | `True, False, continue = True` |

You can use the `type()` function to determine the data type:
```python
a = 'Yeah, my name is ...'

print(type(a))
```

### Converting data types
Sometimes it makes sense to change the data type of a variable. This can be done as follows:
```python
a = '5'
b = int(a)

print(type(b))
```

### Operators
Operators allow you to perform various operations on variables and their values. In general, you have a left-hand side and a right-hand side and an operator in the middle:
```python
x = 10
y = 5

print(x + y)
```
Python uses two types of operators: arithmetic operators and assignments.

### Arithmetic operators
Arithmetic operators are used to perform calculations such as addition, subtraction, division and multiplication. Here are some of the arithmetic operators you can use:

| type | descrition | example                                        |
|-------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------|
| +      | Addition operator         | `1 + 1`                            |
| -      | Subtraction operator     | `2 - 1`                  |
| /      | Division operator         | `9 / 3` |
| *      | Multiplication operator         | `3 * 4` |

### Assignment operators
You can use assignment operators to assign values to a variable throughout its life cycle. Below you will find some assignment operators that you are likely to use when creating programs:

| type | example                     |
|-------------|----------------------|
| =       | `x = 2`                   |
| +=      | `x += 2` - x is increased by 2. If x previously contained "2", it now has the value "4".|
| -=      | `x -= 2` - x is decreased by 2. If x previously contained "2", it now has the value "0".|
| /=      | `x /= 2` - x is divided by 2. If x previously contained "2", it now has the value "1".|
| *=      | `x *= 2` - x is multiplicated by 2. If x previously contained "2", it now has the value "4".|


And here is the some code with syntax highlighting:
```python
def add(x,y):
    return x + y

print(add(2,4))
```
