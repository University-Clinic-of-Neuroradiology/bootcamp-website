## üìù Theoretical basics
For some information on the topic, take a look at the [![Slides](https://img.shields.io/badge/Go%20to-slides-pink.svg)](https://raw.githack.com/University-Clinic-of-Neuroradiology/python-bootcamp/main/notebooks/DataManagement/slides/Datamanagement.slides.html#/).

### Pandas
`pandas` is a spreadsheet application for Python and offers user-friendly functions for data tables. Importing the `pandas` library gives IPython notebooks fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with ‚Äúrelational‚Äù or ‚Äúlabeled‚Äù data both easy and intuitive.

`pandas` ia a framework - i.e. a collection of functionality, not a program on its own. It is based on the numerical mathmatics framework `numpy`.

While `numpy` is more directed to highly optimized numeric calculations, `pandas` offers additional convenience and utility for dealing with tabular data. In turn, it sacrifices some processing speed.

### What is pandas used for?
Its main application cases is data processing. This includes: Reading, exploring, cleaning, transforming and visualizing data.

Common areas that make use of it are:
- Data Science
- Machine Learning

### Where to find help?
Here you will find all the necessary information about `pandas` and their functionalities: [Official Documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/).

**Key Points**: - pandas is a data processing framework based on numpy
                - It offers additional utility functions but sacrifices speed

### How to get pandas?
It can be installed via `pip` (c.f. pandas on pypi.org). Make sure that the dependencies are installed as well.

### Series and DataFrames
The primary two components of pandas are the `Series` and `DataFrame`.

A `Series` is essentially a column, and a `DataFrame` is a multi-dimensional table made up of a collection of `Series`.

A Pandas `DataFrame` is a two-dimensional, labeled data structure within the Pandas library for Python. Resembling a table or spreadsheet, it consists of rows and columns, where each column can hold different data types (numeric, string, boolean, etc.). The `DataFrame` provides powerful tools for data manipulation, cleaning, analysis, and exploration. It allows for easy indexing, slicing, merging, reshaping, and aggregating data, making it a versatile and fundamental tool in data science and analysis workflows.

A Pandas `Series` is a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding various data types (integers, strings, floats, etc.) in a tabular form. It resembles a column in a spreadsheet or a simple array/list with associated index labels for each element.

### Medical data file formats

| Format Name | File Extension | Origin                                         |
|-------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------|
| XML         | .xml           | Extensible Markup Language                     |
| RD          | .rd            | R Documentation                                |
| EDF         | .edf           | European Data Format                           |
| BDF         | .bdf           | BioSemi Data Format                            |
| CSV         | .csv           | Comma Separated Values                         |
| XLSX        | .xlsx          | Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet                    |

### Read CSV
The `pandas.read_csv()` function is a versatile tool in the Pandas library used to read and load data from a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file into a Pandas `DataFrame`. It offers a simple and efficient way to import data by specifying the file path or URL. This function supports a wide range of parameters to handle various CSV file formats, handle missing or malformed data, specify delimiters, and customize data types.
```python
import pandas as pd

csv2df = pd.read_csv('/Data/data.csv')
```

### Read JSON
The `pandas.read_json()` function within the Pandas library is designed to efficiently read and load JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data into a Pandas `DataFrame`. It provides a straightforward method to ingest JSON data from a file, string, or URL and convert it into a structured Dat`DataFrame`aFrame format. This function supports various options for handling JSON data with different structures, including nested objects and arrays.
```python
import pandas as pd

json2df = pd.read_json('/Data/data.json') 
```

### What is data preprocessing?
Data processing refers to several steps:
- Beyond cleaning and exploratory data analysis
- Prepping data for modeling
- Modeling in python requires numerical input

### Working with data types
There are different dtypes in pandas:
- `object`: string/mixed types
- `int64`: integer
- `float64`: float
- `datetime64`: datetime

### Exploring data types
We want to know what types we'll be working with as we start to do more preprocessing:
```python
df = pd.read_csv('/dataset/brain_volumes.csv')

print(df.dtypes)
```
```bash
patient_id          object
brain_vol           object
```

### Converting a column type
If you take a look at the dataset types, you'll see that the column `brain_vol` is type `object`. But, if you actually look at the column, you'll see that it consists of integers. Let's convert that column to type `int`.
```python
# Convert the brain_vol column to type int
df['brain_vol'] = df['brain_vol'].astype(int)

# Look at the dtypes of the dataset
print(df.dtypes)
```
