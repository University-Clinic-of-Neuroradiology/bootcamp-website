## 📄 Description
To round off our boot camp, we have put together a little project for you. Here we want to put your acquired knowledge to the test. The project will only cover topics that were part of the previous boot camp. However, if you get stuck at any point, please use the discussion forum or take another look at the respective skill tracks. Programming is like learning a language, you learn best when you exchange ideas with others.

There is no "one right" solution to the project. Although we have a sample solution, we give you the freedom to find and submit your own solutions. In the end, however, the results must be correct.

We have set aside about 2 hours for the final project.


## 📣 Current announcements
After you have completed the project, we have prepared a sample solution for you that presents the solution. **Remember:** There are many possible solutions and we only present one possible alternative in the sample solution!

If you want us to check your solution, have a look at the [📝 Submission process](#-submission-process).


## ❗ Course requirements
- you should have completed all previous skill tracks
- in this notebook we use data from open-source databases (the references are at the bottom of the page); in Google Colab the data is loaded automatically at the beginning of the notebook


## 📝 Submission process
Save your solution to Google Drive with all outputs or download it to your computer. You can find the options in the tab under "File" in the top left corner.

Make sure that all the necessary cells are readable. To be able to send us the files you have to create zip-files of your files, because .py or .ipynb are blocked by Outlook.

You can then contact the e-mail address python.bootcamp@med.ovgu.de.
