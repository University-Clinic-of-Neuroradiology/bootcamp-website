## 📄 Description
Unlock the power of Python in healthcare data analysis with our condensed introductory course. Dive into the essentials, decode medical data, and pave the way for transformative innovations. This is your first step toward a future where code heals.


## 📣 Current announcements
We would like to introduce you to our first version of the Python Bootcamp. The content is certainly not yet perfect and will be improved and expanded by us in the future. We are always happy to receive feedback, so please get in touch if you have any ideas, requests or suggestions, or if you spot a bug.


## ❗ Course requirements
- a laptop or desktop computer (no specific requirements except an internet connection)
- during the course, please visit this website OR the GitHub repository to stay up to date.

{: .box-note}
**Note**: Before the course starts, please make sure, that Google Colab is working on your device. We can not provide installation or technical assistance during the course for each participant. Please, ensure before the beginning of the course, that you can access the online compiler of your choice (e.g., create a Google account) and that you know how to operate it (again, during the course we can not provide installation or technical assistance for each participant).


## 📋 Syllabus
We recommend the following sequence of skill tracks:
1. [Introductory](./python_basics.md)
2. [DICOM](./dicom.md)
3. [Image Analysis](./image_analysis.md)
4. [Data Management](./data_management.md)
5. [DeepLearning](./deep_learning.md)

So we offer also an optional skill track, what else you can do:
- [Time Analysis](./time_analysis.md)
- [Object Oriented Programming in Python](./object_oriented_programming.md)

**Note**: The chapters are available as Jupyter notebooks on <a href="https://github.com/University-Clinic-of-Neuroradiology/python-bootcamp/main"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Go%20to-GitHub-green.svg" alt="Generic badge" /></a>, which can also be opened on <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/University-Clinic-of-Neuroradiology/python-bootcamp/blob/main"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/></a>.


## 🚩 Project
Once you have completed all the skill tracks, a final project is prepared. In this project, you will work on a problem set by us. To do this, you should have understood all the content you have already completed, otherwise you will repeat the corresponding notebooks.

Click here for the project: [Project](./project.md).
