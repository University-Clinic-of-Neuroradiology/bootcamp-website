- Classes and Objects
- Inheritance
- Examples


## 📣 Current announcements
We are currently working on notebooks. Please check back later and stay tuned for what's coming next...


## ❗ Course requirements
This workshop is intended for learners who have a basic understanding of working with Python like
- Variables, data types, functions
- Loops, conditionals

but may not yet have worked with any object-oriented language.

You should be able to work with a Python tool of your choice (e.g. Jupyter, Google Colab or any other) and know how to write and run Python modules (i.e. files with Python code in it).
