## 📄 Description
This directory contains a few basic notebooks to expand your deep learning knowledge. Working with Keras and TensorFlow, you’ll learn about neural networks, the deep learning model workflows, and how to optimize your models.

By the end of these notebooks, you should feel more comfortable with:
- with the basics and the terms of Deep Learning
- to use Keras to train and test models


## 📣 Current announcements
For this skill track, it doesn't matter what kind of chatbot you prefer to use. However, we have tested everything with ChatGPT (OpenAI). 


## ❗ Course requirements
- basic knowledge of a chatbot of your choice
- have a look at the theoretical basics before you start with the notebooks
