## 📄 Description
This directory contains a set of curated notebooks to help you master prompt engineering for healthcare and beyond. Using real-world medical examples and interactive exercises, you’ll learn how to communicate effectively with language models like ChatGPT, design safe and precise prompts, and apply them in clinical, educational, and research settings.

By the end of these notebooks, you should feel more comfortable with:

  - The basics and terminology of prompt engineering
  
  - Designing effective prompts to guide AI language models
  
  - Applying prompt techniques in healthcare and scientific scenarios

## 📣 Current announcements
For this skill track, it doesn't matter what kind of chatbot you prefer to use. However, we have tested everything with ChatGPT (OpenAI). 


## ❗ Course requirements
- basic knowledge of a chatbot of your choice
- have a look at the theoretical basics before you start with the notebooks
