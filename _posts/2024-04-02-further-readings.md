## Official documentation websites
As mentioned in the [introduction](../courses/theoretical_basics/basics.md), the official developers’ documentation websites act as a glossary paired with very good examples and often tutorials:

- https://www.python.org/doc/, https://docs.python.org/3/
- https://matplotlib.org
- https://numpy.org/doc/
- https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/


## Community forums
A great help is also provided in community forums, e.g., [stackoverflow.com](https://www.stackoverflow.com), that has a bunch of Q+A with example code snippets.


## Cheat sheets
Very useful cheat sheets are provided by [Datacamp.com](https://www.datacamp.com/cheat-sheet).


## Online tutorials
Online tutorials, which go beyond the scope of our course, e.g.:
- https://python101.pythonlibrary.org/intro.html - a very good glossary and tutorial website, that gives a broader introduction into general Python functions.
- python-course.eu ([English](https://python-course.eu/python-tutorial/), [German](https://www.python-kurs.eu/index.php)) - a very good and detailed introduction into general Python programming with extended examples.
- [IPython Interactive Computing and Visualization Cookbook](https://ipython-books.github.io/), Second Edition (2018), by [Cyrille Rossant](https://cyrille.rossant.net/). The online version of this book is free and it provides an excellent introduction to data analysis with Python paired with a large amount of very good code examples
