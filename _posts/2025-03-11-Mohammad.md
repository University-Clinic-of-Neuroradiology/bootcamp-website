Hey there, Python and AI enthusiasts!

## Who am I?
Hey there! Iâ€™m Mohammad Rezapourian, a researcher and AI developer passionate about medical imaging, deep learning, and generative AI. My academic journey began with a B.Sc. in Medical Engineering (Bio-electrics) at the University of Isfahan, where I started working with AI for medical applications early in my studies. Currently, Iâ€™m pursuing my M.Sc. in Medical Systems Engineering at Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg, specializing in AI-driven solutions for healthcare.

Over the past few years, Iâ€™ve worked extensively in AI-driven medical imaging, computer vision, and augmented reality (AR) for surgical guidance. I have contributed to various research projects that blend deep learning, robotics, and real-time tracking to improve needle segmentation, 3D localization, and AI-assisted diagnostics.

## Why I am here?

At UniversitÃ¤tsklinik fÃ¼r Neuroradiologie, Klinikum Magdeburg, my role is to:
âœ… Develop and optimize the website for AI-related courses and research content.
âœ… Create Jupyter Notebooks and structured projects to enhance AI education.
âœ… Assist students and researchers in learning the latest AI advancements, particularly in medical AI and prompt engineering.

Alongside my work at the Klinikum, Iâ€™m also a Research Assistant at the STIMULATE Research Campus, where I contribute to AI-driven medical imaging, computer vision, and augmented reality (AR) for surgical navigation. My research integrates deep learning, robotics, and real-time tracking to improve needle segmentation, 3D localization, and AI-assisted diagnostics.

## Why Did I Decide to Work Here?
Joining UniversitÃ¤tsklinik fÃ¼r Neuroradiologie, Klinikum Magdeburg was a natural step in my journey, as it allows me to combine my expertise in AI, web development, and education to contribute to meaningful projects in medical AI. My role here involves:

âœ… Developing and optimizing the AI course website, ensuring accessibility and usability for researchers and students.
âœ… Creating structured Jupyter Notebooks and interactive learning materials to make AI concepts easier to grasp.
âœ… Collaborating on AI-driven projects that enhance research and clinical applications.
âœ… Helping researchers and students learn the latest advancements in AI, particularly in Prompt Engineering and medical imaging applications.

Iâ€™m excited to continue learning, sharing, and collaborating with like-minded researchers and professionals. Letâ€™s shape the future of AI in medicine together!
