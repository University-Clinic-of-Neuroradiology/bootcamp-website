Hey there, Python and AI enthusiasts!

At Applied AI, we're always striving to equip students and enthusiasts with the tools and knowledge to harness the power of artificial intelligence in innovative ways. We're excited to announce that we're working on a brand-new course series focused on Prompt Engineering, designed to help you unlock the full potential of large language models (LLMs).

## Who am I?
Hey there! I’m Mohammad Rezapourian, a researcher and AI developer passionate about medical imaging, deep learning, and surgical navigation. My academic journey started with a B.Sc. in Medical Engineering (Bio-electrics) from the University of Isfahan, where I explored speech and language disorder analysis in children. Currently, I’m pursuing my M.Sc. in Medical Systems Engineering at Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg, specializing in AI-driven medical applications.

Over the past few years, I’ve worked extensively in AI-driven medical imaging, computer vision, and augmented reality (AR) for surgical guidance. I have contributed to various research projects that blend deep learning, robotics, and real-time tracking to improve needle segmentation, 3D localization, and AI-assisted diagnostics.
## What Can You Expect from Our Course?
Our course series will cover both the basics and advanced techniques of prompt engineering:

1. Introduction to Prompt Engineering
  - What makes a good prompt?
  - Key principles and common pitfalls.
  - Real-world examples to get you started.

2. Advanced Prompting
  - Complex scenarios and multi-turn conversations.
  - Structuring prompts for specific tasks, like summarization or data extraction.
  - Tips for improving LLM usability and efficiency in practical applications.

## When Will It Be Available?
We’re currently in the development phase, creating engaging lessons and practical exercises to ensure you get the best learning experience possible. Our goal is to publish these courses at the beginning of the new year.

## Why Should You Learn Prompt Engineering?
With LLMs becoming integral to fields like healthcare, research and content creation, knowing how to communicate effectively with these systems is a game-changer. This course is perfect for:
- Beginners in all disciplines.
- Developers building applications powered by LLMs.
- AI enthusiasts looking to deepen their understanding of LLM capabilities.
Stay tuned for updates as we finalize this exciting new offering. We can’t wait to share our work with you and help you become a pro at navigating the world of AI with precision and creativity.
