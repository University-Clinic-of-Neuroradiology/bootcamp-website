Hey there, Python and AI enthusiasts!

At Applied AI, we're always striving to equip students and enthusiasts with the tools and knowledge to harness the power of artificial intelligence in innovative ways. We're excited to announce that we're working on a brand-new course series focused on Prompt Engineering, designed to help you unlock the full potential of large language models (LLMs).

## Who am I?
Hey there! I’m Mohammad Rezapourian, a researcher and AI developer passionate about medical imaging, deep learning, and surgical navigation. My academic journey started with a B.Sc. in Medical Engineering (Bio-electrics) from the University of Isfahan, where I explored speech and language disorder analysis in children. Currently, I’m pursuing my M.Sc. in Medical Systems Engineering at Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg, specializing in AI-driven medical applications.

Over the past few years, I’ve worked extensively in AI-driven medical imaging, computer vision, and augmented reality (AR) for surgical guidance. I have contributed to various research projects that blend deep learning, robotics, and real-time tracking to improve needle segmentation, 3D localization, and AI-assisted diagnostics.
## Why Did I Decide to Work Here?
Joining Universitätsklinik für Neuroradiologie, Klinikum Magdeburg and STIMULATE Research Campus aligned perfectly with my career goals. These institutions focus on cutting-edge AI applications in healthcare, allowing me to:

Apply AI to real-world medical challenges, particularly in image analysis, segmentation, and robotic-assisted procedures.
Work on AI-driven surgical navigation, helping to develop precision guidance systems.
Contribute to AI education, particularly in Prompt Engineering for medical applications.
Collaborate with leading researchers in medical AI, neuroradiology, and image-guided surgery.
At this intersection of AI, medicine, and innovation, I see endless opportunities to advance healthcare with AI-driven solutions. My long-term vision is to establish an AI company dedicated to transforming medical diagnostics and surgical assistance.

I’m excited to continue learning, sharing, and collaborating with like-minded researchers and professionals. Let’s shape the future of AI in medicine together!



## What Have I Done So Far?

My experience spans across multiple roles and projects, each sharpening my expertise in AI for medical applications:

1. Research Assistant (AI Developer) at STIMULATE Research Campus

  Developed deep learning models for needle detection and segmentation in CT images.
  Integrated AI with camera tracking systems to enhance real-time surgical navigation.
  Worked on 3D tracking algorithms to improve precision in needle base and tip localization.
2. Software Developer (AI & Web Systems) at Universitätsklinik für Neuroradiologie, Klinikum Magdeburg

  Applied Prompt Engineering techniques to improve AI-driven interactions.
  Developed and optimized a course website for AI education.
  Ensured quality assurance of digital platforms and interactive elements.
3. Intern at SURAG Medical GmbH
  
  Worked on robotic control strategies for surgical applications using Franka Emika robots.
  Designed and optimized motion planning algorithms for needle insertion.
4. Research Assistant at AIDIA Lab, University of Isfahan

  Developed deep learning models for medical image segmentation and detection, focusing on OCT images.
  Researched transformers and GANs for medical image enhancement and LLMs for AI-driven diagnostics.
  Implemented self-supervised learning and attention-based architectures for improved performance.
Alongside my research, I have been actively teaching and mentoring, conducting Python, machine learning, and deep learning workshops. I also have experience as a Teaching Assistant in Numerical Computations and Advanced Programming.


## Why Am I Interested in Generative AI?
Why Am I Interested in Generative AI?
Generative AI is revolutionizing medical imaging by enabling better image reconstruction, segmentation, and even synthetic data generation for training AI models. My research has already explored GANs, transformers, and self-supervised learning in OCT segmentation, laryngeal lesion classification, and CT image denoising.

I believe that Generative AI holds immense potential for personalized medicine, where models can simulate and predict treatment outcomes, aid in diagnosis, and even assist in surgery planning. By harnessing LLMs, diffusion models, and transformer-based architectures, we can push the boundaries of AI-assisted healthcare.

## Why Should You Learn Prompt Engineering?
With LLMs becoming integral to fields like healthcare, research and content creation, knowing how to communicate effectively with these systems is a game-changer. This course is perfect for:
- Beginners in all disciplines.
- Developers building applications powered by LLMs.
- AI enthusiasts looking to deepen their understanding of LLM capabilities.
Stay tuned for updates as we finalize this exciting new offering. We can’t wait to share our work with you and help you become a pro at navigating the world of AI with precision and creativity.
