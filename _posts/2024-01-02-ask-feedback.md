Hello everyone,

We hope you’re enjoying using our Python Bootcamp. We’re always looking for ways to improve our content and notebooks and make them more useful for you. That’s why we’re asking for your feedback.

We want to hear from you about what you like and don’t like about e.g. our notebooks. What features do you find helpful? What features do you think are missing? What could we do to make our notebooks more user-friendly?

Your feedback is very important to us, and we’ll use it to make our Python Bootcamp better.

You can find on each skill track a link to a Google formular!

Thank you!

We hope this helps. Let us know if you have any other questions or if there’s anything else we can help you with.
