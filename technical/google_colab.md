## Start a jupyter notebook in Google Colab

Google Colab, or Google Colaboratory, is a cloud-based platform for writing and running Jupyter notebooks using Google‚Äôs cloud resources. It provides free access to CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs, making it ideal for resource-intensive tasks like machine learning and data analysis.

The following browsers have been tested and are therefore recommended: Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Safari (MacOS).
